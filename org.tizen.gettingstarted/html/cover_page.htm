<p><strong>Welcome to Tizen!</strong></p>

<p>Tizen is a user-interactive and service-oriented open source project that allows you to create feature-rich applications for multiple device categories.</p>

<p>Tizen is designed to be equally friendly to embedded systems developers and Web developers alike, and its flexible nature encourages its use on an array of devices, including TVs, smart phones, watches, tablets, In-Vehicle Infotainment, and smart appliances. Tizen provides a Native API that provides the benefits of building software for embedded systems in C; it also provides a Web API that allows you to create simple programs using only HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>To get started with the development of your own Tizen applications:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create your first simple native application, and learn about the main features available for implementing your dream application:

	<li><a href="native/wearable_widget/first_app_widget_wn.htm">Creating Your First Wearable Native Widget Application</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Create your first simple Web application, and learn about the main features available for implementing your dream application:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="web/mobile/first_app_mw.htm">Creating Your First Mobile Web Application</a></li>
	<li><a href="web/wearable/first_app_ww.htm">Creating Your First Wearable Web Application</a></li>
	<li><a href="web/wearable_watch/first_app_watch_ww.htm">Creating Your First Wearable Web Watch Application</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="type" name="type">Tizen Application Types</h2>

<p>The Tizen platform supports 2 primary application types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Application</strong> is developed using C and can access more advanced device-specific features, such as camera, GPS, and accelerometer in addition to more advanced system settings and functionality.
<p>The native applications use the Native API, which provides all of the memory management and performance benefits that come with building applications for Linux in C. The Native API is extremely helpful, as it includes dozens of API modules that cover a large range of capabilities. It provides numerous interfaces to much of the hardware that is found in modern mobile and wearable devices, and does so in an environment that is tailored for limited resources.</p></li>
<li><strong>Web Application</strong> is essentially a Web site stored on your device and built using Web-native languages, such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The Web application uses the Tizen Web Framework to interact with the native subsystems.
<p>The Web applications use the Web API, which is a standard Web application project structure with basic elements. The Web API is designed to allow you to easily build applications using Web-native languages.</p>
<p>A program built using the Web API is laid out much like a standard Web site with an <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">index.html</span> file that serves as the root, and separate directories for resources, such as JavaScript, CSS, images, and sound resources. This approach makes Web application development in Tizen extremely intuitive for developers with a background in Web development, and makes it easy to quickly write simple applications using high-level languages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following figure illustrates the Tizen architecture model supporting the 2 application types.</p>
<p class="figure">Figure: Tizen architecture</p> 
<p align="center"><img src="images/what_is_tizen_architecture.png" alt="Tizen architecture" /></p>

<p>The Tizen platform also allows you to develop a hybrid application package where native and Web applications are packaged together to make more powerful applications. The Tizen platform ensures that all Tizen applications have consistent look and feel, regardless of whether you use the native or Web framework to create them.</p>

<h2 id="profiles" name="profiles">Tizen Profiles</h2>

<p>Tizen is built to work on a wide variety of platforms with a focus on embedded devices. In order to accommodate the various types of devices, a set of profiles has been defined to make it easier to develop applications for specific purposes and device types. In the 2.4 SDK, there are 2 profile types you can choose from: mobile and wearable. The mobile profile is designed for smart phones, and the wearable profile is designed for smart watches.</p>

<p>Both profiles are supported in native and Web application types.</p>

<h2 id="doc" name="doc">Tizen Documentation</h2>

<p>To make the most of your Tizen applications, get familiar with the Tizen documentation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Getting Started
	<p>The getting started documentation provides overall information you need to become familiar with Tizen programming and application model. The documentation also walks you through creating your first Tizen application.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="../../org.tizen.ui.practices/html/cover_page.htm">UI Practices</a>
	<p>The Tizen UI practices instruct you in planning and developing a user interface for your application. The content introduces all the available UI toolkit frameworks.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="../../org.tizen.tutorials/html/cover_page.htm">Tutorials</a>
	<p>The Tizen tutorials teach you how to incorporate Tizen features into your application. The tutorials contain detailed code examples to help you write the required code in practice.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="../../org.tizen.guides/html/cover_page.htm">Guides</a>
	<p>The Tizen guides introduce the various features that you can use in creating Tizen applications. You can select an API domain to implement its functionalities into your Tizen application.</p>
	</li>
	<li><a href="../../org.tizen.web.apireference/html/cover_page.htm">API References</a>
	<p>The Tizen API References provide descriptions of all the Tizen API domains, subdomains, classes, interfaces, functions, and methods.</p>

</ul>	
	

<p>When using the Tizen documentation, look for the profile icons on the upper right corner of each page. The icons (listed in the following table) indicate which profiles the topic applies to. &quot;N&quot; in the icon stands for the native application profiles and &quot;W&quot; for the Web application profiles.</p>
