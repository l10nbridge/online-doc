<h3>Changed Features</h3>

<ul>

	<ul>
	<li>If a 32-bit version of the JRE/JDK is installed on a 64-bit OS, the Installer/Update Manager displays a message leading to install the 64bit version of the JRE/JDK.</li>

		<li>When installing a package, the Update Manager installs its required packages together.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Web IDE
	<ul>
	<li>The CSS Editor uses CSSLint instead of W3C CSS Validation for syntax check.</li>

	<li>The <strong>Resource</strong> view has been replaced by the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> view.
		<ul>
		<li>When you open an older project version than 2.4 Rev5, the <strong>Resource</strong> view still remains in the perspective. To update to the <strong>Resource Manager</strong> view, click <strong>Tizen Native</strong> on the Perspective toolbar, open the context menu, and click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The drag-and-drop method of the resource file has been changed. 
		<ul>

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The meta XML schema of the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">layout.xml</span> file has been changed by using simple terms for the element name, attribute name, and attribute value instead of somewhat unfamiliar EFL terms.

		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>UI Component
		<ul>
		<li>The View Container in the Palette has been removed. The naviframe component in the View Container is also removed.</li>
		<li>Instead of the removed naviframe, which worked as the background and navigation for the app&#39;s views, the Native UI Builder offers simple view-transition methods, such as clicking a component (if its link property is set) on the view object and double-clicking the reference to the view object in the <strong>Navigation</strong> view.</li>
		<li>The icon component has been removed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Native UI Builder project resources
		<ul>
		<li>The name of the layout meta file has been changed from <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">&quot;layout.tuml&quot;</span> to <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">&quot;layout.xml&quot;</span>.</li>
		<li>The <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">app.xml</span> file has been removed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>

	<li>Support for monospace font types has been added.</li>
	<li>The Editor popup supports the back key to reset the modification.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator
	<ul>
	<li>In the Emulator Manager CLI, to clear the relationship among the options, the option <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">-p, --path</span> of the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">create-image</span> command has been changed to the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">-d, --directory</span> (<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">-p</span> meant both <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">platform</span> and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">path</span>). </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Installer and Update Manager
	<ul>
	<li>The SDK update and installation failure from the image file has been fixed.</li>
	<li>On Mac OS&reg;, the installer does not work properly if there are several mounted installers. This bug has been fixed by setting the volume name of the installer in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">&#39;RELEASE_NAME&#39;</span> format.</li>
	<li>When a user stopped the old installer while installing, the older installer did not delete the installation directory, such as &#39;tizen-sdk&#39; (default installation directory). This bug has been fixed. The new installer deletes the installation directory if the installation is canceled.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Web IDE
	<ul>
	<li>When you open the context menu in the source editor, the <strong>Run Configurations</strong>, <strong>Debug Configurations</strong>, and <strong>Profile Configurations</strong> submenus of <strong>Run As</strong>, <strong>Debug As</strong>, and <strong>Profile As</strong> did not appear. This bug has been fixed in this release.</li>
	<li>The bug that caused the privilege checker not to work properly sometimes has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Enventor
	<ul>
	<li>Enventor now creates a config home folder properly if it does not exist.</li>
	<li>The bug that caused the last item in the candidate list to be unselectable has been fixed.</li>
	<li>Enventor dismisses a contextual popup properly when EDC has a compile error.</li>
	<li>Enventor dismisses a contextual popup when a warning popup is shown up at window exit.</li>
	<li>The incorrect display size of the live view has been fixed.</li>
	<li>The template code logic which was wrongly inserted has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Installer and Update Manager
	<ul>
	<li>Some errors in the update command of the 2.4 rev1 and rev2 CLI Installer have been found. If you use the 2.4 rev1 or rev2 CLI installer, you fail to update your Tizen SDK. To solve the problem, CLI installer patch files are released. Download the <a href="https://download.tizen.org/sdk/patches" target="_blank">CLI installer patch files</a> and do the following:
		<ul>
		<li>Open the terminal or command line, and go to the location where the downloaded patch file exists.</li>
		<li>Move the patch file to the location where the SDK is installed.</li>
		<li>At the prompt, type <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">update-manager-cli_2.4_patch update_{OS}_{bit}.{bin|exe}</span> to install the patch.</li>
		</ul>
	<p>You can also upgrade your CLI Installer to the 2.4 rev3 at the <a href="download.htm">Tizen SDK Download page</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>If there is a multibyte character in the Tizen SDK installation path, some development packages have a difficulty in finding the installed SDK&#39;s location when they are working.</li>
	<li>When you run the dynamic analyzer on Mac OS&reg; X, the SDK Update Notification does not appear even though there are available SDK updates.</li>
	<li>If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS&reg; X, a terminal (<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">shell.exec</span>) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native IDE
	<ul>
	<li>When you import some projects generated from Tizen 2.3 Rev2, the importing can take some time.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> feature in the native project&#39;s <strong>Properties &gt; C/C++ Build</strong> does not work properly.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native UI Builder
	<ul>
	<li>When the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows&reg; is running, project deletion does not work properly. To deal with this problem, close the editor.</li>
	<li>If the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows&reg; runs for more than 12 hours, your computer slows down because of the editor&#39;s high memory usage. To free from this situation, restart the Tizen IDE.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator
	<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu sometimes stops responding for a few seconds after closing the Emulator Manager. This issue is related to an IBus (Intelligent Input Bus) bug. When the issue occurs, restart the ibus-daemon by entering the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">ibus-daemon –drx</span> command at the command prompt, and use another framework, such as uim and fcitx, for multilingual input.</li>
	<li>To use the Tizen Emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver provided by the vendor. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen Emulator from <a href="sdk_prerequisites.htm">Prerequisites for the Tizen SDK</a>.
		<ul>
		<li>If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus&trade; technology on either Ubuntu or Windows&reg;, you must set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia&reg; graphics card. In case of Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee" target="_blank">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee</a>). In case of Windows&reg;, select &quot;High Speed NVIDIA Processor&quot; as &quot;Preferred Graphics processor&quot; in the Nvidia&reg; control panel.</li>
		<li>On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can  sometimes appear transparent.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, if a &#39;failed to allocate memory&#39; error occurred while executing the Emulator, try the following:
		<ul>
		<li>Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.</li>
		<li>If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.</li>
		<li>Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072</span> command on the console with administrator rights (Windows&reg; 7 only), and reboot.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and Nvidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 &amp; v2.0</strong> option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 &amp; v3.0</strong> option.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>SDB
	<ul>
	<li>To use the SDB bash completion feature, enter the source <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">.sdb-complete.bash</span> command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from Tizen 2.4 official due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
