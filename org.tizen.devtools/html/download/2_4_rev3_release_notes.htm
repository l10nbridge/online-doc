<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Installer and Update Manager
	<ul>
	<li>The update command of the 2.4 rev1 and rev2 CLI Update Manager has some errors. If you use the 2.4 rev1 or rev2 CLI Update Manager, the Tizen SDK update fails.  To solve the problem, use the CLI Update Manager patch files. Download the patch at the <a href="https://download.tizen.org/sdk/patches" target="_blank">download location</a> and do the following (or upgrade your CLI Update Manager to the 2.4 rev3 at the <a href="download.htm">Tizen SDK Download page</a>.). For detailed information, see the <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/community/tip-tech/patch-cli-installer" target="_blank">CLI Installer Patch Guide</a>.
		<ul>
		<li>Open the terminal or command line (with Administrator privileges on Windows&reg;), and go to the location where you have downloaded the patch file.</li>
		<li>Move the patch file to the location where the SDK is installed.</li>
		<li>At the prompt, enter the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">update-manager-cli_2.4_patch_{OS}{bit}.{bin|exe}</span> command to install the patch.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If there is a multibyte character in the Tizen SDK installation path, some development packages have a difficulty in finding the installed SDK&#39;s location when they are working.</li>
	<li>When you run the dynamic analyzer on Mac OS&reg; X, the SDK Update Notification does not appear though there are available SDK updates.</li>
	<li>If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS&reg; X, a terminal (shell.exec) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native IDE
	<ul>
	<li>When you import some projects generated from Tizen 2.3 Rev2, the importing can take some time.</li>
	<li>The <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> feature in the <strong>native project&#39;s properties > C/C++ Build</strong> does not work properly.</li>
	<li>When you run some filtered test cases with the native Unit Test tool, the test application can crash.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator
	<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu sometimes stops responding for a few seconds after closing the Emulator Manager. This issue is related to a bug of IBus (Intelligent Input Bus). When the issue occurs, restart the ibus-daemon by entering the ibus-daemon â€“drx command at the command prompt, and use another framework, such as uim and fcitx, for multilingual input.</li>
	<li>To use the Tizen Emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver which the vendor provides. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen Emulator from:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="sdk_prerequisites.htm">Prerequisites for the Tizen SDK</a>.</li>
		<li>If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus&trade; technology on either Ubuntu or Windows&reg;, you must set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia&reg; graphics card. In case of Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee" target="_blank">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee</a>). In case of Windows&reg;, select &quot;High Speed NVIDIA Processor&quot; as &quot;Preferred Graphics processor&quot; in the Nvidia&reg; control panel.</li>
		<li>On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can appear transparently sometimes.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, if a &#39;failed to allocate memory&#39; error occurred while executing the Emulator, try the following:
		<ul>
		<li>Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.</li>
		<li>If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.</li>
		<li>Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072 command on the console with administrator rights (Windows&reg; 7 only). And reboot.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and NVidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 &amp; v2.0</strong> option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 &amp; v3.0</strong> option.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>SDB
	<ul>
	<li>To use the SDB bash completion feature, enter the source .sdb-complete.bash command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from Tizen 2.4 official due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
