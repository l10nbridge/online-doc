<h4>Native Framework</h4>

<p>The Tizen platform provides a new API for native applications in Tizen 2.3, replacing the previous Tizen 2.2.1 Native API. The primary development language for native applications has changed from C++ to C. However, the C++ standard library has been provided as an open source library, so C++ can still be used to create the application logic that does not use any Tizen platform features. This big change has been made for the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>The Tizen native framework currently only supports the mobile profile. However, in the near future, multiple other device profiles, such as wearable and TV will be supported. A new Native API is required to ensure that the native framework is lightweight and fast to run well on both low- and high-end profiles and devices.</li>
<li>With the new native framework, minimal porting effort is required to run native applications on multiple Tizen device profiles.</li>
<li>Improved scalability, and fast, themeable, and easily customizable graphics are now possible by using the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL).</li>
<li>More than 10 open source libraries are now available to third-party applications through the native framework. This is particularly advantageous for developers who are already familiar with some of these libraries, because they can quickly add features and use previous written code in certain cases.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that you cannot use the new Tizen 2.3 SDK to develop native applications that have been written with the older Tizen SDKs. If you want to develop a native application written with an older Tizen SDK, rewrite your application with the new Tizen 2.3 SDK. The signature changes of Native APIs from Tizen 2.3 Beta to Tizen 2.3 release can be found from <a href="http://download.tizen.org/misc/change-log/Native%20API%20Changes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4>Web Framework</h4>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<ul><li>Web Device API</li>
</ul><ul><li>The following Wearable Web Device APIs have been added in this release to allow a richer variety of features to be implemented in wearable Web applications: 
<ul><li>Badge API (tizen.badge)
<ul><li>Overlays an image with the number of unread notifications for an application on the application&#39;s Home screen icon. The image is known as a badge.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Human Activity Monitor API (tizen.humanactivitymonitor)
<ul><li>Provides support for pedometers, heart rate monitors (HRMs), and GPS tracking features to determine the device&#39;s geographical location and changes, such as velocity changes. It also supports the detection of &quot;wrist-up&quot; motions. For example, if a smartwatch user rotates their wrist to look at their watch screen, the application can detect this and present content on the screen.</li>
<li>Only HRMs are supported on the Tizen 2.3 mobile and wearable Emulator.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MediaKey API (tizen.mediakey)
<ul><li>Provides methods to handle multimedia keys, such as the volume control or pause buttons on a Bluetooth headset connected to the Tizen device.</li>
