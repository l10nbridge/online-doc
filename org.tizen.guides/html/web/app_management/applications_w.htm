  <h1>Applications</h1> 
 
<p>The <a href="../../../../org.tizen.devtools/html/cover_page.htm">Tizen SDK</a> enables you to create Web applications for mobile and wearable devices. A Web application comprises HTML, JavaScript, and CSS combined in a package, which can be installed on the Tizen device. A <a href="../../../../org.tizen.tutorials/html/web/process/app_dev_process_w.htm#package">Web application package</a> includes all the support files that are needed by the Web application. Therefore, a Web application can run without any additional external resources or network connectivity after installation.</p> 
 
<p>The Application API is mandatory for both Tizen mobile and wearable profiles, which means that it is supported in all mobile and wearable devices. All mandatory APIs are supported on the Tizen Emulators.</p> 

 
<h2 id="app_models">Web Application Models</h2>

<p>The application models support a rich set of standard W3C/HTML5 features, which include various JavaScript APIs as well as additional HTML markups and CSS features. These features along with the Tizen Device APIs and UI framework support can be used to create rich Web applications in a variety of categories, such as contact, messaging, device information access, multimedia, graphics, and games.</p> 

<p>Tizen provides various application models to allow you to create applications targeted for specific tasks:</p>
<ul>
	<li>UI Application
	<p>The UI application is the most general Tizen application that has a graphical user interface. You can create diverse applications with a variety of features, and design versatile applications and intriguing user interfaces with text and graphics while taking advantage of many device functionalities, such as sensors and call operations. In addition, you can, for example, manage content and media files, use network and social services, and provide messaging functionality.</p></li>
	
	<li><a href="service_app_w.htm">Service Application</a>
	<p>The service application is a Tizen Web application without a graphical user interface that runs in the background. They can be very useful in performing activities (such as getting sensor data in the background) that need to run periodically or continuously, but do not require any user intervention.</p></li>
	
	<li>Widget Application
	<p>The widget application (or widget) is the specialized application that is useful in providing users with quick view of specific information from the parent application. Also, the widget allows users to access certain features without launching the applications. Combined with its parent application, your widgets may have various features to increase usability of your applications.</p></li>
	
	<li>Watch Application <strong>in wearable applications only</strong>
	<p>Tizen watch application is one of Tizen Web applications for wearable devices. It can be shown on the idle screen of the wearable device.</p></li>
</ul>
  
   <h2 id="package" name="package">Application Package Manager</h2> 
  <p>The application package manager is one of the core modules of the Tizen application framework, and responsible for installing, uninstalling, and updating packages, and storing their information. Using the package manager, you can also retrieve information related to the packages that are installed on the device.</p> 
  <p>The application package manager module is expandable to support various types of applications, and designated installation modules can be added to it. </p>

 <p align="center"><img alt="Application package manager" src="../../images/application_package_manager.png" /></p> 
 
   <p>Tizen supports both Web application packages and hybrid application packages, which combine a Web application and 1 or more native service applications. Applications in the same package follow the same installation life-cycle, handled by the application package manager.</p>
