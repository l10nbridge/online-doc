<p>Tizen native guides introduce various features for native applications. The features are supported in the native API, and you can use them in creating Tizen applications.</p>

  <table class="note"> 
   <tbody> 
    <tr> 
     <th class="note">Note</th> 
    </tr> 
    <tr> 
     <td class="note">If you have an application based on the Tizen 2.3, use the <a href="migration_guide_n.htm">Migration Guide</a> to make it conform to Tizen 2.4 Application Framework APIs.</td> 
    </tr> 
   </tbody> 
  </table>  

<p>Select the feature you are interested in and see what Tizen offers for your application:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="app_management/app_management_cover_n.htm">Application Management</a>

<p>The application management features cover the various application models available for native applications. They describe the application life-cycle and resources, and the communication methods available for the application.</p></li>

<li><a href="ui/ui_cover_n.htm">User Interface</a>

<p>The user interface features define how to use the UI framework, which is a universal, reusable software environment that provides the essential building blocks to facilitate the development of Tizen native applications. The framework provides the window, UI components, and scene-based graphic rendering architecture needed to manage your application user interface. You can create the UI using either the EFL (Enlightenment Foundation Libraries) or DALi (Dynamic Animation Library) UI toolkit framework.</p></li>

<li><a href="internationalization/internationalization_cover_n.htm">Internationalization</a>

<p>The localization features define how you can ensure that your application works around the world in different locales and time zones. You can provide the UI texts in your application in multiple languages, and ensure that the time and date information is given correctly based on the current location of the device.</p></li>

<li><a href="graphics/graphics_cover_n.htm">Graphics</a>

<p>The graphics features introduce how you can improve the visual look of your application through efficient use of images. You can handle graphics using various graphic libraries and interfaces, such as Cairo and OpenGL ES. You can also improve the performance of your graphic application with hardware acceleration.</p></li>

<li><a href="notification/notification_cover_n.htm">Notifications and Content Sharing</a> <strong>in mobile applications only</strong>

<p>The notifications and content sharing features introduce how you can inform the user of important events and allow the user to share content between applications.</p></li>

<li><a href="alarm/alarms_n.htm">Alarms and Scheduling</a>

<p>The alarms and scheduling features introduce how you can define and store alarms. You can use the alarm trigger to launch applications as and when the user needs them.</p></li>

<li><a href="media/media_cover_n.htm">Media and Camera</a>

<p>The media and camera features cover everything related to multimedia. You can record and play various media formats, use the device camera to take pictures, and listen to the radio. You can also handle media conversions, manage media streams, and take advantage of media key events.</p></li>

<li><a href="connectivity/connectivity_cover_n.htm">Connectivity and Wireless</a>

<p>The connectivity features define how you can connect your application to the outside world, and send and receive data. You can create connections to various networks, servers, and other devices.</p></li>

<li><a href="messaging/messaging_cover_n.htm">Messaging</a>

<p>The messaging features introduce how you can send and receive text and multimedia messages, and manage emails. You can also create a push server to use the push messaging service to deliver push notifications to the application.</p></li>

<li><a href="location_sensors/location_sensors_cover_n.htm">Location and Sensors</a>

<p>The location and sensor features provide information about the geographical location and surrounding environment of the device. You can create location-based applications that track the user location and use maps. You can also access data from various device sensors, which provide information on the physical environment the device is in, and the gestures and activities the user is engages in.</p></li>

<li><a href="text_input/text_input_cover_n.htm">Text Input and Voice</a>

<p>The text input and voice features introduce how you can convert speech to text and back to speech, or provide customized keyboards. You can also define commands to allow the user to control the application with their voice.</p></li>

<li><a href="personal/personal_cover_n.htm">Personal Data</a> <strong>in mobile applications only</strong>

<p>The personal data features cover the handling of secure data related to the user. You can manage and sync user accounts, and authenticate the user to allow them to access services. You can also manage various user data in the device, such as their contact and calendar information.</p></li>

<li><a href="data/data_cover_n.htm">Data Storage and Management</a>

<p>The data storage and management features cover the methods you can use to handle data in your applications. You can access data from the device system and various storages.</p></li>

<li><a href="device/device_cover_n.htm">Device Settings and Systems</a>

<p>The device settings and systems features introduce how you can set and get information about the system. You can also access information about attached devices, and display the application output in an external device screen.</p></li>

<li><a href="security/security_cover_n.htm">Security</a>

<p>The security features ensure that private information remains private, and that the user knows when they are trying to access privileged information. You can use a repository to manage keys, certificates, and sensitive user data. And when the user tries to access privileged information, you can display information about the data.</p></li>

<li><a href="error/error_cover_n.htm">Error Handling</a>

<p>The error handling features are needed when everything does not go as planned. You can handle error situations in your application code, and ensure that necessary information is stored in the system logs to allow you to troubleshoot problems.</p></li>

<li><a href="performance/performance_cover_n.htm">Performance</a> <strong>in mobile applications only</strong>

<p>The performance features define how you can use tracepoints. You can generate traces and visualize them to help you to optimize your application performance.</p></li>
