<h1>Bluetooth</h1>

<p>Tizen enables you to use Bluetooth functionalities, such as managing the local Bluetooth adapter, bonding, and exchanging data between Bluetooth-enabled devices. The Bluetooth standard provides a peer-to-peer (P2P) data exchange functionality over short distance between compliant devices.</p>
<p>The main features of the Bluetooth API include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Managing the local Bluetooth adapter 
	<p>The Bluetooth Adapter API (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__ADAPTER__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__ADAPTER__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for setting up Bluetooth and discovering other devices. The API is used to control the Bluetooth adapter: you must enable the adapter before any other Bluetooth actions, and when you no longer need it, disable it to save device power.</p>
	<p>You can control the visibility of the device, meaning whether its name appears to others searching for Bluetooth devices. In addition, you  discover neighboring Bluetooth devices. This process is asynchronous, so you must build and hold the list of devices in the neighborhood.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Discovering devices 
	<p>The Bluetooth Device API (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__DEVICE__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__DEVICE__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for managing bonds with other devices and searching for supported services. The API is used to handle the connection with other devices and to search for services available on remote devices.</p>
	<p>You can discover other Bluetooth devices. The device discovery process can retrieve multiple types of Bluetooth devices, such as printers, mobile phones, and headphones.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Creating a bonding with a Bluetooth device 
	<p>You can create a bonding with another device. The bonding allows the 2 devices to establish a connection.</p>
	<p>Connected devices exchange keys needed for encrypted communication, but each connection has to be approved by the latest application user. You can also set authorization of other devices. Authorized devices are connected automatically without the latest user being asked for authorization.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Connecting to and exchanging data with a Bluetooth device using a Bluetooth socket
	<p>The Bluetooth Socket API (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__SOCKET__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__SOCKET__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for managing connections to other devices and exchanging data. The API is used for exchanging data between 2 Bluetooth devices, where your device can have the role both of a server (service provider) and client (service user). The connection creation process differs based on the role. After the connection is established, the processes for exchanging data and disconnecting are the same for both roles.</p>
	<p>When you attempt to open a connection to another device, a Service Discovery Protocol (SDP) look-up is performed on the device, and the protocol and channel to be used for the connection are determined. If a connection is established and the socket is opened successfully, a <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">BluetoothSocket</span> instance with an open state is returned. The socket is subsequently used for exchanging data between the connected devices.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Connecting to audio devices with Bluetooth
	<p>Connect to Bluetooth audio devices, such as headset, hand-free, and headphone.</p></li>
	<li>Handling attributes with Bluetooth GATT
	<p>The Bluetooth GATT API (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__GATT__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__GATT__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for discovering, reading, and modifying attributes.</p>
	<p>As a client, you can connect to and use a specific service on the server device. Once the connection is established, the client can manage the service attributes.</p></li>
	<li>Connecting to health devices with Bluetooth HDP
	<p>Manage connections to health devices and exchange data.</p></li>
	<li>Connecting to devices with Bluetooth HID
	<p>Connect to a Bluetooth HID, such as a keyboard or mouse.</p></li>
	<li>Sending and receiving objects with the Bluetooth OPP client and server
	<p>Push and accept objects, such as pictures.</p></li>
	<li>Exchanging data with Bluetooth LE
	<p>The Bluetooth LE Adapter API (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__ADAPTER__LE__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__ADAPTER__LE__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for managing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections with other BLE devices and exchanging data between them.</p>
	<p>You can control the visibility of the BLE device, meaning whether its name appears to others searching for BLE devices. In addition, you  discover neighboring BLE devices. This process is asynchronous, so you must build and hold the list of devices in the neighborhood.</p>	
	</li>	
	<li>Controlling remote audio and video devices with Bluetooth AVRCP
	<p>The Bluetooth AVRCP feature (in <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.mobile.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__MODULE.html">mobile</a> and <a href="../../../../org.tizen.native.wearable.apireference/group__CAPI__NETWORK__BLUETOOTH__MODULE.html">wearable</a> applications) provides functions for remotely controlling audio and video devices.</p>
	<p>Bluetooth AVRCP is used with A2DP. You can handle remote controls (such as play, pause, stop, equalizer, repeat, shuffle, and scan) through AVRCP.</p></li>	
</ul>

<p>Bluetooth use is based on profiles. Tizen Bluetooth features support the Audio, GATT, HDP, HID, and OPP client and server profiles.</p>
