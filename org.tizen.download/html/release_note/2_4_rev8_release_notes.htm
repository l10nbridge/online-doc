<h1>Tizen 2.4 Rev8 Release Notes</h1>

<ul> 
   <li>Release Date: Aug 2, 2016</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2 id="ide_tools">IDE and Tools</h2>

<h3>New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>CLI/SDB
	<ul>
	<li>When you specify commands to be executed during the pre-build or post-build steps in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">build_def.prop</span> file, you can use the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">PROJ_PATH</span>, <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">BUILD_CONFIG</span>, and <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">BUILD_ARCH</span> environment variables in the commands.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Native UI Builder
	<ul>
	<li>When you build the UI of a wearable application, you cannot use the Panel UI component. The component is not supported in wearable applications.</li>
	<li>Support for new APIs for the wearable widget have been added. Old APIs in the project code of the wearable widget, which were shared with the wearable application, have been replaced with the new APIs.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Web IDE
	<ul>
	<li>The first execution of the <strong>Build Package</strong> command for Web application projects sometimes failed due to a JavaScript validation problem. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native IDE
	<ul>
	<li>When you tried to debug an application running on a connected target device through the <strong>Debug As &gt; Tizen Native Application – Attach</strong> menu, you could not attach the debugger to the application in the <strong>Debug Configurations</strong> dialog. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	<li>When you exported a package with multiple projects to a CLI project, and one of the projects was a Static and Shared Library project, the information of the referenced library project was not set in the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">def.prop</span> file of the reference project. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native UI Builder
	<ul>
	<li>The Tizen Store did not accept a wearable circle application developed by the native UI Builder, because some blacklist APIs were used in the Builder. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	<li>When an event handler was added to a view layout, if the view layout contained an event-handler-added UI component, an error occurred. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator
	<ul>
	<li>Due to an internal problem, the ECP CLI did not provide the correct acceleration values of the 3-axis sensors. This bug has been fixed.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
 
<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<ul>
<li>Installer and Update Manager
	<ul>
	<li>If the SDK Update Notification appears when you start the Tizen IDE or Emulator on Mac OS&reg; X, a terminal (<span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">shell.exec</span>) icon can appear on the dock for a few seconds.</li>
	<li>If there is a multibyte character in the Tizen SDK installation path, some development packages cannot find the installed SDK&#39;s location when they are running.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Web and Native IDE
	<ul>
	<li>If JRE 1.8 is installed on your computer and you select in the IDE menu <strong>Help &gt; Help Contents</strong>, the &quot;HTTP ERROR:500&quot; message can appear in the Help page due to an Eclipse Kepler bug. To see the Help page, see <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/development" target="_blank">https://developer.tizen.org/development</a> or use JRE 1.7.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, if there is a file name in the project containing a non-ASCII character, the project packaging can fail. This issue does not occur on Ubuntu or Mac OS&reg; X.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Web IDE
	<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Preview</strong> tab in the Web Page Editor sometimes does not appear properly. Use an alternative feature, named Web SDK HTML Editor, which has enhanced features compared to the Web Page Editor. Instead of the <strong>Preview</strong> tab in the Web Page Editor, use the preview (<strong>Ctrl+4</strong>) feature of the Web SDK HTML Editor.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native IDE
	<ul>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, when you build a native project containing a PO file, the IDE sometimes stops responding. In this case, create a new workspace and move the project to it. The project may be built successfully there.</li>
	<li>When you import some projects generated in Tizen 2.3 Rev2, the import can take some time.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Native UI Builder
	<ul>
	<li>When the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows&reg; is running, a project deletion does not work properly. To solve the problem, close the editor.</li>
	<li>If the WYSIWYG editor of the Native UI Builder for Windows&reg; runs over 12 hours, your computer slows down because of the editor&#39;s high memory usage. To solve the problem, restart the Tizen IDE.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Emulator
	<ul>
	<li>Ubuntu sometimes stops responding for a few seconds after closing the Emulator Manager. This issue is related to an IBus (Intelligent Input Bus) bug. When the issue occurs, restart the ibus-daemon by entering the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">ibus-daemon –drx</span> command at the command prompt, and use another framework, such as uim and fcitx, for multilingual input.</li>
	<li>To use the Tizen Emulator, install an Intel VTx supported by the CPU, and the latest version of the graphic card driver provided by the vendor. Check the prerequisites for the Tizen Emulator from <a href="../install/sdk_prerequisites.htm">Prerequisites for the Tizen SDK</a>.
		<ul>
		<li>If the host machine is using Nvidia Optimus&trade; technology on either Ubuntu or Windows&reg;, you must set the Tizen Emulator to run with your Nvidia&reg; graphics card. In case of Ubuntu, check the bumblebee project (<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee" target="_blank">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee</a>). In case of Windows&reg;, select &quot;High Speed NVIDIA Processor&quot; as &quot;Preferred Graphics processor&quot; in the Nvidia&reg; control panel.</li>
		<li>On Ubuntu, if the graphics driver is out-of-date, your Ubuntu desktop session can be occasionally logged out when launching the Emulator Manager, or the Emulator skin can be drawn improperly. Check the prerequisites and upgrade to the latest graphics driver.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>On Ubuntu 14.04, a shortcut menu can sometimes appear transparent.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, depending on your OS theme (such as Non-Aero themes and Windows XP themes), a display surface can be erased for a while if the Emulator window is covered with another window. If you click the Emulator window, the display surface runs correctly again.</li>
	<li>On Windows&reg;, if a &#39;failed to allocate memory&#39; error occurs while executing the Emulator, try the following:
		<ul>
		<li>Close some other programs and try to launch the Emulator again.</li>
		<li>If the RAM size is set to 768 or 1024 MB for the VM in the Emulator Manager, change it to 512 MB.</li>
		<li>Increase the user area of the virtual memory in the system to 3 GB by entering the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">bcdedit /set increaseuserva 3072</span> command on the console with administrator rights (Windows&reg; 7 only), and reboot.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If you use a MacBook Pro which has both Intel HD and Nvidia GPUs, when you execute the Emulator with the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v1.1 &amp; v2.0</strong> option, the Emulator can be unexpectedly terminated. Use the <strong>OpenGL ES ver. v2.0 &amp; v3.0</strong> option.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>SDB
	<ul>
	<li>To use the SDB bash completion feature, enter the <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace">source .sdb-complete.bash</span> command on the bash shell. The feature runs manually from the official Tizen 2.4 release onwards due to the Installer and Update Manager issue.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
